## Goal
Build a small playable game using spec-driven AI development.

## Rules
- Spec before code
- Always playable
- Commit often

Start with pasting the prompt in "./Initial prompt.md" into M365 Copilot or equivalent in order to get the intial file content for the files in ./spec

## Workflow
Spec → AI → Run → Commit

## Instructions to AI
- The working dir for this game is in the current dir "example2"
- The spec if found at ./spec
- The code is in ./src


## What I did

### Version 1, I gave this game idea:
i want the user to run a car through a maze, with arrow buttons steering it. runnable in the browser

### Version 2, I gave this prompt:
in my car game there is a 2d overview of the car. i want a 3d display from a 3rd person view of the car above to drive it like that. the maze walls should be quite high. update my spec-docs first and post relevant questions to me. it is OK to use some simple npm project for 3d rendering
