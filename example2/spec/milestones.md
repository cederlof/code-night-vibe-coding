# Milestones

## M1: Playable Core
**Goal:** Completable maze with working physics and timer

- Static small maze (e.g., 10×10 grid)
- Car sprite with position and rotation
- Arrow key input (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)
- Acceleration, braking, friction, and turning with drift
- Wall collision detection with rebound and speed penalty
- Goal area (highlighted)
- Win detection (reach goal)
- Timer: starts on first input, displays current time
- Restart button (R key)

**Done when:** You can navigate start to finish and see your time.

## M2: Polish & Feedback
**Goal:** Smooth, responsive experience

- Speedometer display
- Best time saved in localStorage
- Best time shown on win screen or HUD
- Tune physics constants (acceleration, friction, turn rate, bounce)
- Visual feedback for collisions (optional: flash/shake)
- Smooth rendering (requestAnimationFrame)

**Done when:** Controls feel tight and time-beating is satisfying.

## M3: Configurability & Iteration
**Goal:** Adjustable difficulty and replayability

- Maze size/complexity config (small/medium/large presets or custom)
- Multiple static maze layouts (swap via dropdown/button)
- Optional: reset best time button
- Optional: visual improvements (better sprites, goal animation)

**Done when:** Player can choose maze size and try different layouts.
