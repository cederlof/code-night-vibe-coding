# Vision

A minimal obstacle course runner focused on time improvement and leaderboard competition.

## Core Experience
- Watch your runner move smoothly across a fixed obstacle course
- Time jumps to clear obstacles
- Beat your personal best and climb the leaderboard

## What Makes It Fun
- Clear time improvement feedback loop
- Smooth, satisfying running animation
- Leaderboard competition

## What It Is Not
- Not a score-based game (time only)
- Not a level-based progression system
- Not a skill tree or upgrade system
- Not a story-driven experience
