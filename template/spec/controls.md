## Movement Mechanics
- Players control forward speed by pressing movement key (W for P1, Numpad 8 for P2)
- Faster key presses = faster movement speed
- Slower key presses or no presses = speed decreases
- Speed has minimum and maximum limits
- Strafing uses smooth animated transitions in discrete steps
- Lane boundaries limit horizontal movement

## Timing
- Jump must be timed to clear obstacles
- No horizontal movement control
- No ducking or sliding
